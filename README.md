## Own Dark 001

A sleek, minimalist dark theme designed for clarity, comfort, and long coding sessions.
The UI foundation is inspired by **VS Code's Dark Modern** and the elegant simplicity of **One Dark**, while the syntax highlighting is built on a refined, pastel interpretation of the **Nord** color palette.

### Features

- Calm, balanced, and low-contrast color scheme for focused work
- Syntax highlighting derived from the **Nord** palette, softened with subtle pastel accents
- Familiar UI tones based on **Dark Modern**, enhanced with One Dark–style polish
- Clean, quiet visuals ideal for Angular, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, and template-heavy projects
